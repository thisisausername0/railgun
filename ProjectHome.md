This tool is to demonstrate the "Slow HTTP POST" and "Slow Loris" DoS vulnerabilities in various webservers. It is hoped that our tool will allow administrators to stress test their servers to see how easy it is for a remote attacker to launch Denial of Service attacks against them.

We take no liability for misuse of this software.
